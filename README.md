# Tick It Off - a ToDo app

## Thank you for coming to this page!

Tick It Off is a solo-project I decided to create in order to streamline my learning/work activities: I tend to perform better when I organize my activities beforehand.
Also, being able to tick a task off a list is VERY satisfying for me.

While looking for a position as a Software Developer, I decided to create something all by myself, not following any kind of predefined path. Since I'm usually eager to learn new stuff, I decided to do so while learning React-Native.

I decided to avoid using any book/tutorial and see if I was ready to research, read docs and make some mistakes in order to learn how to write a fully functional (web)App in React Native. 

Since I'm a very VERY curious person, I decided to find a creative way to host this whole app (backend and frontend) on an old computer I've got at home - so please bear that in mind if the app is being quite slow.
